# Network Pruning of Object Detectors

**Description:** Developed a network pruning design by converting the algorithm for handling the residual chains present in the backbone
architectures for halting recursive chain removals. This standalone stage provided with 2-3X speedup and 3-4X
memory improvements on embedded devices.

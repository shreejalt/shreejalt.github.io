# <center> Some things I know in life! &#128526; </center>

Hi Guys. I am a passionate engineer interested in Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Generative AI. I love to develop deep learning
based computer vision algorithms that can have a real imapct in terms of performance, generalizability, and outreach of its solution. 
Developing the algorithms for surviellance industry for more than **five years** have given me the ***"deep" understanding behind DNNs(Pun Intended !)*** and I will cherish
and contine my chase for Applied AI in solving real world problems. My Masters thesis is also based on the Highway Traffic Analytics where I need to develop real-time high performance analytics pipeline mainly optimized for the highway networks. 

I also like to write the technnical explainations of the Deep Learning Research Papers. Dont forget to
visit on my [Medium](https://shreejaltrivedi.medium.com/) Page.


Apart from the academica, I like to play cricket üèè, football ‚öΩ, and badmintion üè∏. I also like to read books related to sci-fi, thriller, cosmology, and astrophysics.
Not to forget, I am a huge Real Madrid Fan. HALA MADRID !. <img src="https://media3.giphy.com/media/6qqgGk1rTcN85n0sb7/giphy.gif?cid=790b76116682c84af773af79dbbd07998594812d31e67b12&rid=giphy.gif&ct=s" height="40" width="40" align="center"/>

Last but not least, I am a Pok√©mon freak. I judge a person based on which starter pokemon they choose. I choose Charmender! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3VQDfP4q4ZYyY/giphy.gif?cid=790b7611vqgq9ft2nspcr4xvu7gu7cgely5ykg2m6h8ng4ev&ep=v1_gifs_search&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g" height="37.6" width="50" align="center"/>

### Projects
- [Intelligent Traffic Light Control System](https://github.com/shreejalt/AdaptiveTrafficLights)
  > Created a prototype for automating the traffic light timers by doing dynamic timer set-stop transitions at the
  crossroads for Ahmedabad. Density calculation was done through two different approaches viz Deep Learning: TFNet YOLO Detection and Computer Vision/ Image Processing: Foreground extraction.

- Classification of Gender from Tweets and their Profile Description
  > Gender classification from Tweets and their profile description through Natural Language Processing for
formatting the tweets and C 4.5 Decision for featurization and Shallow Neural Networks for classification of the gender from the formatted tweets. We reached **84% accuracy** on the test set

- [Thread Management System](https://github.com/shreejalt/ThreadLib)
  > We developed a thread management library to create, schedule, and kill threads(Operating System). All these
operations were done on the kernel level with the use of Linux system calls. The library had similar functionalities as pThread in Linux.

- [Saliency Map Generation from Images](https://github.com/shreejalt/MLNet-Pytorch)
  > Extraction of saliency maps from two different approaches i.e., Supervised and Semi-Supervised. The supervised
approach follows [discriminative features integration with superpixel image segmentation followed by finding saliency scores with Random Forest Regression](https://github.com/shreejalt/Graph_Image_Segmentation). The semi-Supervised approach follows Autoencoder based approach with an attention layer to find the saliency maps from images.
